# Anticipation vs. Interpretation

Evaluate whether a conclusion is an "anticipation of nature" (a hasty generalization from insufficient evidence) or a proper "interpretation of nature" (a conclusion methodically induced through systematic observation). Tests the quality of inductive reasoning.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Is this conclusion justified?"
- Someone presents a generalization that seems hasty
- Evaluating whether research findings are reliable
- Need to distinguish correlation from causation claims
- Assessing confidence in a prediction or pattern
- Request to "check this inference" or "validate this generalization"
- Before acting on a conclusion to verify its foundation
- Reviewing claims made from data analysis

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| conclusion | Yes | The generalization, prediction, or causal claim being evaluated |
| evidence | No | The observations or data supporting the conclusion |
| method | No | How the conclusion was reached |
| stakes | No | What depends on this conclusion being correct |

---

## The Core Distinction

### Anticipation of Nature (Anticipatio Naturae)

**Definition:** A hasty generalization formed by the mind jumping prematurely from limited observations to sweeping conclusions.

**Characteristics:**
- Leaps from few instances to general rule
- Accepts first plausible explanation
- Confirms existing beliefs rather than testing them
- Ignores counter-instances or explains them away
- Produces confident conclusions without sufficient foundation

**Bacon's Warning:** "The anticipations of nature are strong enough to gain agreement, because even though they might be contradicted by countless other instances, they might still find a handful of instances that would confirm them."

### Interpretation of Nature (Interpretatio Naturae)

**Definition:** A conclusion reached through systematic observation, careful exclusion of alternatives, and gradual ascent from particulars to axioms.

**Characteristics:**
- Rises gradually from many observations
- Tests multiple hypotheses before concluding
- Actively seeks counter-instances
- Acknowledges limitations and uncertainty
- Produces tentative conclusions proportioned to evidence

**Bacon's Standard:** "The true method begins with observation, rises gradually to axioms, and only at the last arrives at the most general conclusions."

## The Seven Tests

### Test 1: Sample Adequacy
**Question:** How many instances support this conclusion?

| Level | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| < 5 instances | Strong anticipation risk |
| 5-20 instances | Moderate risk |
| 20+ instances with variety | Interpretation possible |

**Red flag:** Conclusion based on striking examples rather than systematic collection.

### Test 2: Counter-Instance Search
**Question:** Were counter-instances actively sought?

| Approach | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| No search for exceptions | Anticipation |
| Exceptions dismissed or explained away | Likely anticipation |
| Exceptions sought and integrated | Interpretation |

**Red flag:** "Every case I've seen confirms this" (no effort to find disconfirming cases).

### Test 3: Alternative Explanation
**Question:** Were competing explanations tested?

| Approach | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| First plausible explanation accepted | Anticipation |
| Alternatives acknowledged but not tested | Weak |
| Alternatives systematically eliminated | Interpretation |

**Red flag:** Jumping to the explanation that feels right without testing others.

### Test 4: Gradual Ascent
**Question:** Did the conclusion rise gradually from data, or was it formed early and data selected to fit?

| Pattern | Verdict |
|---------|---------|
| Conclusion stated before evidence gathered | Strong anticipation |
| Conclusion evolved with evidence | Interpretation tendency |
| Conclusion resisted despite disconfirming data | Interpretation |

**Red flag:** The conclusion was the starting point, not the ending point.

### Test 5: Acknowledgment of Limits
**Question:** Does the conclusion acknowledge what it cannot claim?

| Claim Scope | Verdict |
|-------------|---------|
| Universal and certain | Anticipation (overclaim) |
| Bounded and provisional | Interpretation tendency |

**Red flag:** "This proves..." "This always..." "Without exception..."

### Test 6: Exclusion Process
**Question:** Were false causes systematically eliminated?

| Approach | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| No elimination process | Anticipation |
| Informal reasoning about alternatives | Weak |
| Systematic Tables of Presence/Absence/Degrees | Interpretation |

**Red flag:** Presence of correlation treated as sufficient evidence of causation.

### Test 7: Mechanism Explanation
**Question:** Is there an account of HOW the cause produces the effect?

| Understanding | Verdict |
|---------------|---------|
| No mechanism proposed | Pattern claim only (not causal) |
| Plausible mechanism suggested | Stronger claim possible |
| Mechanism tested independently | Interpretation |

**Red flag:** "X causes Y" with no explanation of the pathway.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: State the Conclusion Precisely

What exactly is being claimed? Distinguish:
- Pattern claims ("X tends to happen when Y is present")
- Causal claims ("X causes Y")
- Predictive claims ("X will happen in the future")
- Universal claims ("X always/never...")

### Step 2: Phase 2: Apply the Seven Tests

Run each test and record results.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Calculate Overall Assessment

| Tests Passed | Verdict |
|--------------|---------|
| 0-2 | Strong anticipation - do not rely on this conclusion |
| 3-4 | Weak foundation - significant uncertainty |
| 5-6 | Moderate support - conclusion has merit but requires caution |
| 7 | Well-founded interpretation - appropriate confidence |

### Step 4: Phase 4: Determine Appropriate Action

Based on verdict and stakes:
- If anticipation + high stakes: Gather more evidence before acting
- If anticipation + low stakes: May proceed with awareness of risk
- If interpretation + high stakes: Appropriate to act with confidence
- If interpretation + low stakes: Proceed

## Constraints

- Distinguish harshness of assessment based on stakes (higher stakes = stricter tests)
- Do not demand perfection - even good science has limitations
- Recognize that some conclusions are appropriately tentative
- Anticipation is not always wrong - sometimes intuition hits the mark
- The goal is appropriate confidence, not rejection of all imperfect reasoning

---

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "Our customer success team concluded that responding within 1 hour reduces churn by 40%, based on last quarter's data."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Anticipation vs. Interpretation Analysis: Response Time and Churn

### Conclusion Under Examination
**Claim:** Responding to customer inquiries within 1 hour reduces churn by 40%
**Claim Type:** Causal (response time causes reduced churn)
**Stakes:** HIGH - may drive staffing decisions and operational changes

---

### The Seven Tests

#### Test 1: Sample Adequacy
**Instances cited:** "Last quarter's data" - presumably hundreds of customer interactions
**Variety:** Unknown - was it across customer types, inquiry types, times of day?
**Assessment:** PARTIAL
**Notes:** Quantity may be adequate, but variety is unspecified. Sample is only one quarter (potential seasonal effects).

#### Test 2: Counter-Instance Search
**Evidence of search:** Not mentioned
**Treatment of exceptions:** Not discussed
**Assessment:** FAIL
**Notes:** Were there customers who received fast responses but still churned? Were there slow responses where customers stayed? No mention of actively seeking disconfirming cases.

#### Test 3: Alternative Explanation
**Alternatives considered:** None mentioned
**Elimination method:** N/A
**Assessment:** FAIL
**Notes:** Alternative explanations not tested:
- Customers with simple issues (faster to resolve) may be less likely to churn regardless
- Happy customers may reach out for simple things (fast response), unhappy for complex things (slow response)
- Customers who churn may have already decided and their inquiries signal exit

#### Test 4: Gradual Ascent
**Sequence:** Unclear - did the team have this theory first?
**Evolution:** Unknown
**Assessment:** PARTIAL
**Notes:** Cannot determine if conclusion emerged from data or was sought in data.

#### Test 5: Acknowledgment of Limits
**Scope claimed:** "Reduces churn by 40%" - stated as fact, not estimate
**Uncertainty acknowledged:** None mentioned
**Assessment:** FAIL
**Notes:** No confidence intervals, no caveats, no "under these conditions" qualifiers.

#### Test 6: Exclusion Process
**Method used:** Appears to be simple correlation analysis
**Rigor:** Informal at best
**Assessment:** FAIL
**Notes:** No Tables of Presence/Absence. No attempt to control for confounding variables. Correlation is not causation.

#### Test 7: Mechanism Explanation
**Mechanism proposed:** Implied: faster response -> customer feels valued -> less likely to churn
**Testing:** Not independently tested
**Assessment:** PARTIAL
**Notes:** Mechanism is plausible but not verified. Could be selection effect (customers who will stay are easier to help quickly).

---

### Overall Assessment

**Tests Passed:** 0/7
**Tests Partially Passed:** 3/7
**Tests Failed:** 4/7

**Verdict:** STRONG ANTICIPATION

This is a classic anticipation of nature: a striking correlation (40% reduction!) interpreted as causation without systematic testing. The conclusion may be correct, but the evidence does not support it.

---

### Recommendation

**Given the verdict and HIGH stakes:**
Do NOT make staffing or operational decisions based on this conclusion. The 40% figure is untrustworthy.

**To strengthen the conclusion:**

1. **Counter-instance search:** Actively find and analyze cases where fast response did NOT prevent churn. What proportion of churned customers received fast responses?

2. **Alternative explanation test:** Segment by inquiry complexity. Do simple inquiries (faster) have different churn patterns than complex ones (slower) regardless of response time?

3. **Controlled experiment:** Randomize response timing (ethical constraints permitting) to establish causation.

4. **Mechanism validation:** Survey retained vs. churned customers about what factors mattered in their decision.

**Appropriate confidence level:**
LOW - Correlation exists but causation is not established. Act on this only if cost of action is low.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Francis Bacon** expert persona. Use it to evaluate the quality of inductive conclusions. It pairs well with:
- **tables-of-investigation** for properly building conclusions from evidence
- **idol-diagnosis** for identifying biases that produce anticipations
- **light-vs-fruit-classification** for determining if more understanding is needed
